# Architecture Principles

!!! warning

    Proposed changes to these principles are under review by the DHCW TDA

## Deliver sustainable services

All digital services need to be delivered sustainably.

## Put our Tools in Modern Browsers

All digital services should be browser based and utilise open web standards.

## Internet first

All digital services should adopt internet standards and protocols including
setting the default that services are available over the public internet.

## Public Cloud first

Digital services should move to the public cloud unless there is a clear reason
not to do so.

## Build a data layer with registers and APIs

Digital services should only store data once (usually where collected) and make
it available via open APIs whilst maintaining privacy and security.

## Adopt appropriate cyber security standards

Services must adopt the appropriate cyber security standards subject to risk
appetite, including keeping all software, networks and systems up to date.

## Use Platforms

Digital services should build upon existing platforms to deliver their services.

## Ask what the user need is

Every service must be designed around user needs, whether the needs of the
public, clinicians or other staff.

## Interoperability with open data and technology standards

Digital services should adopt open data and technology standards.

## Reuse before buy / build

Digital services should demonstrate that they have sought to reuse existing
solutions before delivering new ones. Where is it not possible to reuse an
existing solution, off the-shelf (commercial or open source) products should be
considered. For open-source products there should be an appropriate level of
contractual support provided. Only having ruled out the former two options
should a new solution be built, either in-house or through third parties
