# GIG Cymru - NHS Wales - Architecture

This site provides NHS Wales architecture related information.

## Principles

See [DHCW Architecture Principles](design-authority/principles/index.md)

## Decisions

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences.

* [Why write architecture decision records - By GitHub Engineering](https://github.blog/engineering/architecture-optimization/why-write-adrs/)

* [A practical overview on Architecture Decision Records: How to start and why this could be your most valuable action as a software architect](https://ctaverna.github.io/adr/)

### First Decisions

Our first decisions are for [DHCW](https://https://dhcw.nhs.wales/) to utilise achitecture decision records, specify how we will name them and agree the format:

* [Introduction](design-authority/dhcw/index.md)

* [Use Architecture Decision Records and Structure](design-authority/dhcw/use-architecture-decision-records-and-structure/index.md)

* [Architecture Decision Records Naming Convention](design-authority/dhcw/architecture-decision-records-naming-conventions/index.md)

* [Format Architecture Decision Records using plaintext Markdown](design-authority/dhcw/format-architecture-decision-records-with-markdown/index.md)

* [Use Material for MkDocs for Publishing](design-authority/dhcw/use-material-for-mkdocs-for-publishing/index.md)

### Creating a new record
